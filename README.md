# 2023_CGVI_Final_Project
This is the code to run "The replacement of the large kernel method in hologram optimization with smaller kernels by SHUKAI HUANG"     

Part 01 implementation: contain all the code to implement the vector kernel method in order.   
Part 02 experiment: integrate all the code together in the part01 to do the experiment of this project including drawing the loss function, calculating the iteration threshold and psnr as well as the reconstruction quality.
